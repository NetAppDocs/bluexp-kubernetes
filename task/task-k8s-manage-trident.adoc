After you add a managed Kubernetes cluster to the Canvas, you can use BlueXP to confirm a compatible Astra Trident installation, install or upgrade Astra Trident to the latest version, or uninstall Astra Trident.

== Astra Trident in BlueXP
After adding Kubernetes clusters to BlueXP, you can manage Astra Trident and your Kubernetes clusters from the overview page. To open the overview page, double-click the Kubernetes working environment on the Canvas.

=== Supported Astra Trident versions
One of the four most recent versions of Astra Trident deployed using the Trident operator--either manually or using Helm chart--is required. If Astra Trident is not installed, or an incompatible version of Astra Trident is installed, the cluster will show there is an action required.

NOTE: Astra Trident deployed using `tridentctl` is not supported. If you deployed Astra Trident using `tridentctl`, you cannot use BlueXP to manage your Kubernetes clusters or uninstall Astra Trident. You must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#uninstall-by-using-tridentctl[uninstall using `tridentctl`^] and reinstall Astra Trident either manually using link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[the Trident operator^] or in BlueXP using <<Install or upgrade Astra Trident>>.  

To learn more about Astra Trident, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html[Astra Trident documentation^].

== Install or upgrade Astra Trident
You can review your Astra Trident installation status and version on the overview page. If Astra Trident is not already installed, or an incompatible version is installed, you can manage that using BlueXP. 

.Steps

. Double-click the Kubernetes working environment on the Canvas or click *Enter Working Environment*.

NOTE: You cannot use BlueXP to upgrade from Astra Trident versions earlier than 21.01. To upgrade from an earlier version, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/upgrade-operator.html[Upgrade with the operator^].

.Results
The latest version of Astra Trident is installed. You can now add storage classes.

== Uninstall Astra Trident
If you installed Astra Trident using BlueXP or using the Trident operator (either Helm or manually), you can uninstall it using BlueXP. 

[NOTE]
====
* After uninstalling Astra Trident you cannot create new persistent volumes, but existing volumes are still available. 
* While Astra Trident is uninstalled, backup is unavailable.
* You can reinstall Astra Trident to the working environment at any time to continue managing clusters. 
====
Uninstalling Astra Trident using BlueXP does not remove all Astra Trident services applied during installation. To completely remove Astra Trident, including all custom resource definitions (CRDs) it creates, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#uninstall-by-using-the-trident-operator[uninstall using the Trident operator^]

.Steps
. From the overview page, select the ellipses and *Uninstall Astra Trident*.
