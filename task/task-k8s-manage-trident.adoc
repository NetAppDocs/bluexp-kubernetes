After you add a managed Kubernetes cluster to the Canvas, you can use Cloud Manager to confirm a compatible Astra Trident installation or install or upgrade Astra Trident to the latest version. 

[NOTE]
===============================
* If Astra Trident is not installed, or an incompatible version of Astra Trident is installed, the cluster will show there is an action required.
* One of the four most recent versions of Astra Trident deployed using the Trident operator--either manually or using Helm chart--is required. 
* Astra Trident deployed using `tridentctl` is not supported. If you deployed Astra Trident using `tridentctl`, you cannot use Cloud Manager to manage your Kubernetes clusters. You must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#uninstall-by-using-tridentctl[uninstall using `tridentctl`^] and reinstall link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[using the Trident operator^] or using the steps below.
