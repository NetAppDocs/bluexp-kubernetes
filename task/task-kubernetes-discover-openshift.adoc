Import a self-managed OpenShift cluster to BlueXP so you can start backing up persistent volumes to your Cloud provider.

== Import a Cluster
You can import a self-managed Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes configuration file.

.Before you begin
Before importing an OpenShift cluster, you need:

* The `kubeconfig-sa`file you created in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-kubernetes/requirements/kubernetes-reqs-openshift.html#create-a-kubeconfig-file[create a kubeconfig file].
* The public Certificate Authority (for example, ca.crt), Client Key (for example, tls.key), and Client Certification (for example, tls.crt) files for the cluster.

.Steps

. On the *Canvas*, select *Add Working Environment*.

. Select your Cloud provider and select *Kubernetes Cluster* > *Discover*.

. Select *Import Cluster* then *Next*.

. Upload the `kubeconfig-sa` file you created in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-kubernetes/requirements/kubernetes-reqs-openshift.html#create-a-kubeconfig-file[create a kubeconfig file]. Select the Kubernetes cluster and select *Next*.
