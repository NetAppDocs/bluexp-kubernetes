Astra Trident is a fully-supported open source project maintained by NetApp. Astra Trident integrates natively with Kubernetes and its Persistent Volume framework to seamlessly provision and manage volumes from systems running any combination of NetApp storage platforms. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html[Learn more about Trident^].

== Features
Using a link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/index.html[BlueXP^] (Cloud Manager) and a compatible version of Astra Trident deployed using the Trident operator, you can:  

* Add and manage Kubernetes clusters

* link:./task/task-k8s-manage-storage-classes.html[Add and remove storage classes]
* link:./task/task-k8s-manage-persistent-volumes.html[View persistent volumes]
* link:./task/task-k8s-manage-remove-cluster.html[Remove Kubernetes clusters] from the workspace
* link:./task/task-kubernetes-enable-services.html[Activate or view BlueXP backup and recovery]

== Supported Kubernetes deployments

BlueXP supports managed-Kubernetes clusters running in:

* link:./requirements/kubernetes-reqs-aws.html[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)]
* link:./requirements/kubernetes-reqs-aks.html[Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)]
* link:./requirements/kubernetes-reqs-gke.html[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]

== Supported Astra Trident deployments

One of the four most recent versions of Astra Trident link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[deployed using the Trident operator^] is required. 

NOTE: Astra Trident deployed using `tridentctl` is not supported. If you deployed Astra Trident using `tridentctl`, you cannot use BlueXP to manage your Kubernetes clusters. You must link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-managing-k8s/uninstall-trident.html#uninstall-by-using-tridentctl[uninstall using `tridentctl`^] and reinstall link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html[using the Trident operator^] or link:./task/task-k8s-manage-trident.html[using BlueXP]. 

You can install or upgrade to the latest version of Astra Trident directly from BlueXP. 

link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html[Review Astra Trident prerequisites^]

== Supported backend storage

NetApp Astra Trident must be installed on each Kubernetes cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Amazon FSx for ONTAP must be configured as backend storage for the clusters.

== Cost

There are no charges to _discover_ your Kubernetes clusters in BlueXP, but you will be charged when you back up persistent volumes using Cloud Backup Service.
