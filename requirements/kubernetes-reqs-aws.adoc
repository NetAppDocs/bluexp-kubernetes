[.lead]
You can add managed Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters or self-managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS to Cloud Manager. Before you can add the clusters to Cloud Manager, you need to ensure that the following requirements are met.

NOTE: This topic uses _Kubernetes cluster_ where configuration is the same for EKS and self-managed Kubernetes clusters. The cluster type is specified where configuration differs.

== Requirements

Astra Trident::
One of the four most recent versions of Astra Trident is required. You can install or upgrade Astra Trident directly from Cloud Manager. You should link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/requirements.html[review the prerequisites^] prior to installing Astra Trident.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP for AWS must be set up as backend storage for the cluster. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/backends.html[Go to the Astra Trident docs for configuration steps^].

Cloud Manager Connector::
A Connector must be running in AWS with the required permissions. <<Prepare a Connector,Learn more below>>.

Network connectivity::
Network connectivity is required between the Kubernetes cluster and the Connector and between the Kubernetes cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP. <<Review networking requirements,Learn more below>>.

RBAC authorization::
The Cloud Manager Connector role must be authorized on each Kubernetes cluster. <<Set up RBAC authorization,Learn more below>>.

== Prepare a Connector

A Cloud Manager Connector is required in AWS to discover and manage Kubernetes clusters. You'll need to create a new Connector or use an existing Connector that has the required permissions.

=== Create a new Connector

Follow the steps in one of the links below.

* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-creating-connectors-aws.html[Create a Connector from Cloud Manager^] (recommended)
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-launching-aws-mktp.html[Create a Connector from the AWS Marketplace^]
* link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-installing-linux.html[Install the Connector on an existing Linux host in AWS^]

=== Add the required permissions to an existing Connector

Starting in the 3.9.13 release, any _newly_ created Connectors include three new AWS permissions that enable discovery and management of Kubernetes clusters. If you created a Connector prior to this release, then you'll need to modify the existing policy for the Connector's IAM role to provide the permissions.

.Steps

. Go the AWS console and open the EC2 service.

. Select the Connector instance, click *Security*, and click the name of the IAM role to view the role in the IAM service.

. In the *Permissions* tab, expand the policy and click *Edit policy*.
+
image:screenshot-aws-edit-policy.png[A screenshot of the AWS console that shows the Edit policy button in the Permissions tab.]

. Click *JSON* and add the following permissions under the first set of actions:
+
* ec2:DescribeRegions

* eks:ListClusters

* eks:DescribeCluster

* iam:GetInstanceProfile

+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[View the full JSON format for the policy^]

. Click *Review policy* and then click *Save changes*.

== Review networking requirements

You need to provide network connectivity between the Kubernetes cluster and the Connector and between the Kubernetes cluster and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that provides backend storage to the cluster.

* Each Kubernetes cluster must have an inbound connection from the Connector
* The Connector must have an outbound connection to each Kubernetes cluster over port 443

The simplest way to provide this connectivity is to deploy the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the same VPC as the Kubernetes cluster. Otherwise, you need to set up a VPC peering connection between the different VPCs.

Here's an example that shows each component in the same VPC.

And here's another example that shows an EKS cluster running in a different VPC. In this example, VPC peering provides a connection between the VPC for the EKS cluster and the VPC for the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Set up RBAC authorization

You need to authorize the Connector role on each Kubernetes cluster so the Connector can discover and manage a cluster.

Different authorization is required to enable different functionality.

Backup and restore::
Backup and restore requires only basic authorization.

Add storage classes::
Expanded authorization is required to add storage classes using Cloud Manager and monitor the cluster for changes to the backend.

Install Astra trident::
You need to provide full authorization for Cloud Manager to install Astra Trident.
+
NOTE: When installing Astra Trident, Cloud Manager installs the Astra Trident backend and Kubernetes secret that contains the credentials Astra Trident needs to communicate with the storage cluster.

.Steps

. Create a cluster role and role binding.

.. Create a YAML file that includes the following text based on your authorization requirements.

.Install Trident
--

Use the command line to provide full authorization and enable Cloud Manager to install Astra Trident.

[source,cli]

eksctl create iamidentitymapping --cluster < > --region < > --arn < > --group "system:masters" --username system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}

--
====

.. Apply the configuration to a cluster.
+
[source,kubectl]
kubectl apply -f <file-name>

. Create an identity mapping to the permissions group.
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Use eksctl
--

Use eksctl to create an IAM identity mapping between a cluster and the IAM role for the Cloud Manager Connector.

https://eksctl.io/usage/iam-identity-mappings/[Go to the eksctl documentation for full instructions^].

An example is provided below.

[source,eksctl]
eksctl create iamidentitymapping --cluster <eksCluster> --region <us-east-2> --arn <ARN of the Connector IAM role> --group cloudmanager-access-group --username system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}

Directly edit the aws-auth ConfigMap to add RBAC access to the IAM role for the Cloud Manager Connector.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html[Go to the AWS EKS documentation for full instructions^].

An example is provided below.

[source,yaml]
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
    - groups:
      - cloudmanager-access-group
      rolearn: <ARN of the Connector IAM role>
